                <p>Pentest is a thrill-packed part round-based, part marathon, exploration and roleplaying game. It is all set against the backdrop of a whimsical metal spacefaring machine masquerading as a spaceship, with charming spritework designed to represent the sci-fi setting and it's dangerous undertones. Have fun, and survive with your crew!</p>
